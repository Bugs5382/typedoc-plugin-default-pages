# TypeDoc Plugin Default Pages

> This is a TypeDoc plugin that will allow you to use the default TypeDoc theme to create pages.  

If you are using this plugin/NPM, please ( :star: ) star this repository, submit PRs, and issues. This way I can make sure the repositories with much usage can be maintained based on demand.

## Features

- 🔍 Search integration
- 🔗 Inner page hyperlinks
- 🎨 Compatible with the default theme
- 🎯 Locate invalid markups

## How To Install

Installing the latest version should be good for the most up-to-date version of TypeDoc. If you need another version, please use that NPM channel to install. 

> npm i typedoc-plugin-default-pages -D

## Keyword Definitions

Keywords such as "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL".
These are standardized terms for technology documentation interoperability.
These words should have these meaning when you are reading them.
They might be sans uppercase throughout the documentation, but they would have the same meaning regardless.

* **MUST** - This word, or the terms "**REQUIRED**" or "**SHALL**", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
* **MUST NOT** - This phrase, or the phrase "**SHALL NOT**", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
* **SHOULD** - This word, or the adjective "**RECOMMENDED**", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
* **SHOULD NOT** - This phrase, or the phrase "**NOT RECOMMENDED**", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful. The full implications should be understood, and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
* **MAY** - This word, or the adjective "**OPTIONAL**", mean that an item is truly optional.  Any implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein, an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation, which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

## Documentation

Documentation is forthcoming...

## Compatibility

Support for this plugin will support many versions to come.
The Initial version will be v0.25.x.
However,
there will be a branch _per_ TypeDoc in this repository and updates will continue as long as that version is supported.

## Acknowledgements

First, this isn't the first plugin to do this.
So I am using code in part by others and in some different.
This package will be 'unit tested'
on any new TypeDoc versions to ensure that it is always up-to-date with the latest TypeDoc app.

Here are the other plugins that have done this:
* [@knodes/typedoc-plugin-pages](https://github.com/KnodesCommunity/typedoc-plugins/tree/develop/packages/plugin-pages) (From typedoc-plugin-loopingz-pages)
* [typedoc-plugin-loopingz-pages](https://github.com/loopingz/typedoc-plugin-loopingz-pages) (From Orginial)
* [typedoc-plugin-pages](https://github.com/mipatterson/typedoc-plugin-pages) (Orginial)
